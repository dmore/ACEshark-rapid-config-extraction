## What is it?
ACEshark is a utility designed for rapid extraction and analysis of Windows service configurations and Access Control Entries, eliminating the need for tools like accesschk.exe or other non-native binaries.

## Why?
- Efficiently identify and analyze service permissions to uncover potential privilege escalation vectors (changing the `binpath` of a service and restarting it).  
- Audit service permissions for specific users or across all groups and accounts.

## How it works
Running ACEshark starts an HTTP server to act as a listener for service configurations and Access Control Entries. It generates a small extractor script based on the specified options, which the user runs on the target machine. ACEshark then retrieves and processes the data, providing a detailed analysis.

## ‚ùóImportant
- Even if a service is characterized as a great candidate for privilege escalation according to its ACEs and configuration, there are other Windows security features that may prevent you from actually abusing it.
- This is probably not going to be particularly stealthy.
